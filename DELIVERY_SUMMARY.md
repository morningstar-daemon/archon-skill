## Helper Scripts (4 utilities, 85 lines)

Located in `scripts/`:

1. **archon-status.sh** — Full network status (JSON)
2. **archon-ready.sh** — Quick health check
3. **archon-resolve.sh** — DID resolution with error handling
4. **archon-stats.sh** — Human-readable network summary

All scripts:
- ✓ Executable permissions set
- ✓ Tested and working
- ✓ Error handling included
- ✓ Usage examples in headers

---

## What It Does

**Read-only access to Archon public network:**
- ✓ Resolve DIDs via W3C spec
- ✓ Query network statistics (153 DIDs, 52 agents)
- ✓ Monitor node health
- ✓ Check DID propagation
- ✓ Verify credential issuers

**Integration ready:**
- Uses OpenClaw's `web_fetch` tool
- Complements local Archon node (TOOLS.md)
- Works with Nostr skill for cross-identity
- HexMem integration for storing resolved DIDs

---

## API Coverage

**Tested endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/status` → Network statistics ✓
- `GET /api/v1/ready` → Health check ✓
- `GET /api/v1/did/<did>` → DID resolution ✓

**Response formats documented:**
- W3C DID Resolution spec
- Error handling (notFound, invalidDid)
- Metadata structure (registry, confirmation, timestamps)

---

## Testing Results

```bash
# Health check
$ ~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-ready.sh
✓ Archon node is ready

# Network stats
$ ~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-stats.sh
Archon Network Status
----------------------
Total DIDs: 153
  Agents: 52 | Assets: 101
  Confirmed: 152 | Unconfirmed: 1 | Ephemeral: 6

Uptime: 2d 18h 14m

Registries:
  Hyperswarm: 149
  BTC Mainnet: 3
  BTC Signet: 1

## Next Steps (Suggested)

1. **Add to heartbeat monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # In HEARTBEAT.md or periodic check
   ~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-stats.sh
   ```

2. **Integrate with credential verification:**
   ```bash
   # When receiving a credential
   ISSUER=$(jq -r '.issuer' cred.json)
   ~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-resolve.sh "$ISSUER"
   ```

3. **Track network growth in HexMem:**
   ```bash
   TOTAL=$(~/clawd/skills/archon/scripts/archon-status.sh | jq '.dids.total')
   hexmem_fact "archon_network" "has_total_dids" "$TOTAL"
   ```

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current scope (public read-only):**
- ✓ Query existing DIDs
- ✓ Monitor network
- ✗ Create new DIDs (requires local Keymaster)
- ✗ Issue credentials (requires local Keymaster)

**For write operations:**
See `TOOLS.md` → Archon Server (local node)

**Potential enhancements:**
- Event stream monitoring (if public API exposed)
- DID search/filter capabilities
- Batch resolution for multiple DIDs
- Integration with browser tool for wallet UI
